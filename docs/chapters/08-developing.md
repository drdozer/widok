# Developing
## API
Widok is still in its early stages and the API may be subject to changes. Any recommendations for improvements are welcome.

## Compilation
To work on the development version of Widok, run the following commands:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:widok/widok.git
$ cd widok
$ sbt publish-local
```

This compiles the latest version of Widok and installs it locally. To use it, make sure to also update the version in your project accordingly.

## Releases
The manual must always reflect the latest version. [Migration](Migration) explains differences between versions.
